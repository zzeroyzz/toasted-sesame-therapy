    `Trauma, woven into our experiences, impacts our mental, emotional, and physical well-being. My focus on trauma therapy aims to create a secure, supportive space for you to regain agency from its effects. I value consent, communication, creativity, empowerment, agency, and resourcing from your own wonderful strengths and qualities.These values are the foundations to deeply respecting and building understanding for each personâ€™s unique experiences of trauma. `

    `Somatic Experiencing is a therapeutic approach that recognizes the profound connection between mind and body. By engaging with sensations and movements, we unlock additional pathways for healing, allowing you to connect with your body in a way that complements traditional talk therapy.`

    `My professional training encompasses insights from both Somatic Experiencing and trauma education, including Internal Family Systems (IFS), Somatic Archeology, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, and Polyvagal Theory. If you feel disconnected from your bodily experience, tend to think more than feel, experience chronic pain or inflammation in connection with emotions, or have resonated with mind-body healing - we can explore if Somatic Experience would be supportive for you.`

    title: 'Identity as a Therapeutic Tool',
    img: Identity,
    content:
    `As a therapist, my commitment to an affirming space is rooted in my identities as a Korean American who is queer, neurodivergent, and living with CPTSD. These aspects of my identity are not only integral to who I am but also serves as a lens through which I approach therapeutic work. Understanding firsthand the intersections of marginalized identities allows me to navigate the nuanced experiences of those I work with, making space for genuine connection and empathy. I wish to bring authenticity to the therapeutic relationship, creating an environment where individuals can explore their own identities, relationships, and paths to healing with openness and understanding. `
